<h2 id="section-1">Wizards and Guilds</h2>

<img src="images/dryad.png" alt="Dryad">

<p>Welcome to the Mystic Circle, my liege. Our wizards await your command. Utilizing the runes obtained from our towers, they can cast a variety of spells to enrich our own province or inflict chaos on our enemies. They will be able to cast as many spells as we wish while they have sufficient mana and the runes required for each spell. Unfortunately, if their mana drops below 10% they will need to rest, but fear not as they will regain mana each day.</p>

<p>You can find a complete overview and list of spells at <a href="http://wiki.utopia-game.com/index.php?title=Mystics" target="_blank" class="button">Mystic Overview</a></a></p>

<p>Our wizards can also assist in attacking and weakening our enemies. They can cast spells that will cause damage over several days and others that will cause immediate damage. Due to the aggressive nature of some spells, they may only be cast on our enemies that have a more combative relationship to our kingdom. The success of our offensive spells depends on how many wizards we have per acre (modified by factors such as Honour, racial or personality bonuses, spells, and science), the enemy's wizards per acre (modified by the same factors), and is also affected by the relative networth of our provinces. The duration of fading offensive spells we cast is affected by our guild percentage.
