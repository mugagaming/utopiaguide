<h2 id="section-1">Scientists</h2>

<p>Sciences, my liege, are the study of knowledge and create our pathway into the future. By studying the laws that govern our being and understanding the effects of these laws, we can strengthen ourselves in all that we do. The mystery of magic and thievery, our military prowess, even our methods of production can all be enhanced through the power of study with an investment in time devoted to those fields. The students of our province will lead us into the future with your careful direction.</p>

<!--With each passing day they become smarter and stronger in their understanding of their subject of study. Over time these students will become so proficient in their craft that their experience will award them much stronger insight into the development of their devoted study. But be careful my Lord, when assigning our students to a new task they will forget all they have learned from their previous endeavor so that they can focus entirely on their new subject. While assigning your students to new tasks can be beneficial it should be carefully considered as this can not be undone.

<h2 id="section-2">The Arts and Sciences</h2>

<p>The scientists of our province are unique. They are recruited to our ranks through a careful process of selection and do not become a part of our general population. Laboratories and the Revelation spell help attract talented scholars to our lands, while Schools and the spell Fountain of Knowledge increase the speed at which our scientists make new discoveries. Finally, Universities work to safeguard our knowledge from our enemies.</p>

<p>We can order each new scientist to focus their studies in one of three major fields: Economy, Military, and the Arcane Arts. Although scientists begin work as soon as they are recruited, as they gain experience in their field, they will become much more productive. As scientists advance in their careers, they will progress through the ranks of Recruit, Novice and Graduate before finally becoming Professors. We are free to command our scientists to focus on a new field of study, however, this will return them to the rank of Recruit. Take care, as this cannot be undone!</p>

<p>Scientists produce numerous books of learning in the course of their studies. It is up to you, my liege, to direct where these studies are focused to strengthen our province.</p>

<p>Students of Economy can undertake learning in various techniques of production and financial management:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Alchemy:</span> Alchemy is the art of changing lead to gold. Knowledge in this area will help us increase our daily tax revenues.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Tools:</span> Creating better tools means more efficient workers. By developing this area of knowledge, we will be able to significantly increase the efficiency of the workers within our buildings.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Housing:</span> Improving the quality and efficiency of housing throughout our lands provides us the opportunity to substantially increase our population without adding more lands.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Production:</span> By researching better production techniques, we can improve the quality of our crops and yield more runes from our towers.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Bookkeeping:</span> Finding new ways for our financial advisors to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce the wages paid to our military.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Artisan:</span> The study of advanced construction techniques allows our builders to erect new structures across our lands more quickly, and at a lower cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Military scholars focus on areas of learning related to combat and army efficiency:</p>

	<li><span class="red">Strategy:</span> Through the study of combat strategy and techniques, our military becomes better able to defend our lands from attack.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Siege:</span> This area of study trains our armies to seize greater amounts of land or resources from our enemies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Tactics:</span> By studying military tactics in greater depth, we can make our military much more powerful when invading enemy provinces.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Valor:</span> Techniques for instilling a sense of gallantry and courage in our armies encourage them to train more quickly, and to be significantly stronger when attacking any Dragons that may roam our lands.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Heroism:</span> The study of heroism allows our military leaders to inspire patriotic feeling among our people, increasing the speed at which we can draft peasants to our military, and decreasing the cost of doing so.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scientists who devote themselves to the Arcane Arts are concerned with a number of skills relating to spellcasting and thievery:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Crime:</span> The study of crime can prove invaluable to your methods of thievery, helping us conduct more effective operations against others as well as providing us a stronger defense against enemy thieves.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Channeling:</span> Magic is a powerful force of the lands. By increasing your knowledge of the history of this art, you can improve your wizards' abilities to cast spells and defend your lands from enemy spell-casters. Dedication to this art can not be replicated anywhere.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Shielding:</span> While the studies of crime and channeling can help us to defend against enemy thievery and magic by improving our own skill in these areas, the study of Shielding allows us to partially protect ourselves from sabotage and spells, reducing the damage caused by our enemies even when they are successful in penetrating our defenses.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Cunning:</span> Our scientists are also able to devise methods of increasing the damage caused by our own magic and thievery operations against our enemies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Invocation:</span> The casting of a ritual for our Kingdom is an expensive endeavour. The study of Invocation improves our magesâ€™ efficiency when casting ritual spells, allowing them to use far fewer runes in the effort.
