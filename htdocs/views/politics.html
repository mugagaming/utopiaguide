<h2 id="section-1">Choosing a leader</h2>

<p>A Kingdom consists of up to 25 individual provinces. It is strongly advised that every kingdom vote for a King or Queen to lead them; a Monarch is required to perform several game functions, and is an important point of diplomatic contact with other kingdoms.

<p>The Monarch is able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Declare war, withdraw from war, and negotiate mutual peace agreements with war opponents</li>
	<li>Offer and accept diplomatic agreements between Kingdoms</li>
	<li>Edit the Monarch Message on the throne page</li>
	<li>Manage the Kingdom forums</li>
	<li>Start and cancel dragons and ritual projects</li>
	<li>Invite new recruits</li>
	<li>Change the Kingdom's name and banner</li>
	<li>Appoint another player as Steward</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary method of selecting a Monarch is for each province to vote for their choice. The elected Monarch for the kingdom must receive at least 50% of the votes, with a lead of at least 2 votes over the runner-up. Every province receives one vote with the founding of their lands; however, increases to nobility rank award us a greater number of votes.</p>

<p>There is another method of seizing power, however, although it is ruthless and very uncommon. If our kingdom has at least three provinces and our province has more than 50% of the kingdom's total networth, then whoever we vote for will become the Monarch.</p>

<p>Those best suited for Monarchy are not necessarily those who are the most active or individually skiilled players; rather, they are the ones most inclined to support the kingdom’s interests and lead their team towards the achievement of their goals.</p>

<p>Being the Monarch of a kingdom is a significant responsibility - not only do Monarchs have a number of powers which have a significant effect on those under their rule, they also represent their kingdoms in the eyes of the Utopian community.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Stewardship</h2>

<p>Once elected, a Monarch has the ability to appoint up to two Stewards to assist in governing the kingdom. A Steward has most of the powers a monarch does. However a Steward cannot alter the kingdom’s name or banner or recruit new provinces.</p>

<p>Many Monarchs seek support from other experienced kingdom members, in addition to their Stewards. Kingdom leadership structures vary between kingdoms, and may include war leaders, thief or mage leaders, dedicated mentors for new provinces, or other roles. Your kingdom and its nominated leaders are your main source of support and guidance as a fledgling province in Utopia.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Communications within your Kingdom</h2>

<p>One of the keys to becoming a successful kingdom is effective communication. To support this, the Utopian Lords have provided numerous methods for us to take advantage of. As with any communication, the tone and content should be respectful and avoid foul language.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Mail</span> - A direct private message between two provinces. Mail can be sent to those outside our kingdom as well as those within. Monarchs and Stewards have the ability to send mail to everyone in their kingdom at once.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Ingame chat</span> - This is a private chat that only our kingdom can access. Many kingdoms choose to link this to a private Discord server (requires the kingdom to purchase the Discord for Intel-Site item from the Shop), which allows players using the ingame chat and players using Discord to easily communicate with each other.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Forum</span> - A private forum that only our kingdom can access. Many kingdoms use their forums for introductions, build and military suggestions, and other information that could be referenced and used regularly. Monarchs and stewards have the ability to remove posts from kingdom forums.</li>
	<li><span class="red">War Forum</span> - During war, a temporary forum is created and shared between both kingdoms. War forums can be a fun place for friendly intra-kingdom banter during the war and to share compliments and suggestions during End of War Ceasefire. As with our kingdom forums, the Monarch and Steward of both kingdoms are permitted to remove posts from the War Forum.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-4">Communications outside of your Kingdom</h2>
<p>Utopia has its own Discord server where you can find more strategy advice and chat to other players. There are also channels to find wars and for recruitment. This is the main social space for the Utopia community. Invite link:<a href="https://www.utopia-game.com/discord" target=blank> CLICK HERE</a></p>

<p>Utopia also has Game Forums where discussions take place, here you will also find information about game announcements such as the changes for each new age.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Recruitment</h2>

<p>Our kingdom's monarch has the ability to invite new rulers to join our kingdom. This allows Utopians to play with friends, meet new friends, or simply find a kingdom with suitable goals and expectations to play with. A new ruler can either establish their own province - choosing their own race, personality, and province name - or if the Kingdom contains an abandoned province, the Monarch can opt to invite a new ruler to assume command of that province in its current state.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Aid</h2>

<p>At times, either we or our kingdom-mates may require additional assistance, and support can be provided by sending certain resources. When we send aid our trade balance increases; however, it also decreases when we receive aid. The values for each resource are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Gold Coin = 1 Gold Coin trade value
	<li>1 Bushel of food = 0.05 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>1 Soldier = 100 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>1 Rune = 3 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>1 Explorable Acre = 500 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>	-Note: There is a penalty for aiding acres. You lose 1 acre for every 2 aided</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are no benefits from having a positive trade balance, once our negative trade balance reaches 4 times our networth, incoming shipments will be taxed. The rate of tax on incoming shipments increases as our trade deficit worsens, so we must be mindful of how we manage our resources! However, the Utopian Lords are forgiving - as time progresses, our trade balance will slowly balance out bringing us closer to a zero trade balance.</p>

<!--
<h2 id="section-7">Stances</h2>

<p>A kingdom's stance is a declaration to the world of our kingdom's intentions and is controlled by the Monarch and Steward. There are three stances to choose from:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Normal</span> - A neutral stance with no inherent bonuses or drawbacks.
	<li><span class="red">Aggressive</span> - Higher combat gains and faster attack speed at the cost of higher wages and more military losses
	<li><span class="red">Fortified</span> - Reduced military training and construction costs, reduced military training and construction time, increased drafting speed, plus higher birth rates at a penalty of no new scientists or progression, significantly higher exploration costs and no paradise spell. Additionally, attack gains are significantly reduced whether attacking from or into a Kingdom that is in Fortified stance. While the protections provided to Fortified Kingdoms slide in over 24 hours, the penalties for attacking from Fortified stance are immediate.
</ul>

<p>There are also several restrictions on the changing of stances, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may not change from Normal or Aggressive stance until 24 Days have passed</li>
	<li>You may not re-enter Fortified stance until 96 hours have passed</li>
	<li>Fortified stance will last for only 72 Days, after which you will be automatically placed into Normal stance</li>
</ul>
-->

<h2 id="section-7">The Hostile Meter</h2>

<p>All relations between our Kingdom and others must be recorded. There are several levels of relations that are possible, and each has effects on how our Kingdoms may interact. Relations worsen with each attack or operation made between our Kingdoms. Traditional March, Plunder, Learn, Massacre, Conquest and Raze attacks add 3 points to the Hostile Meter. Ambushes add 1.5 points, and failed attacks move the meter by a reduced amount which is based on the amount of offense sent relative to opponent defense. Sending a dragon adds 30 points to the Hostile Meter. Thievery operations and spells also affect the Hostile Meter, however have a smaller impact than military attacks or dragons.</p>

<p>As each new Utopian month begins, the hostility levels between our Kingdoms will be slightly reduced.</p>

<p>Our relation levels with each kingdom can be found on that Kingdom's page. The precise number of hostility points between ourselves and any Kingdom is viewable by Monarchs and Stewards, or by other kingdom members if a personal or kingdom Hostile Meter is purchased in the Shop. The different levels of relations are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Non-Aggression Pact:</span> A non-aggression pact entered into by two kingdoms prevents any attacks or aggressive sorcery and thievery operations. It will reset the Hostile Meter between the two kingdoms to zero, effectively cancelling out all previous hostile actions. It will also cancel any Dragon projects that have been started but not completed.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Normal (0-9 Hostile Meter points):</span> The default relation with all kingdoms.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Unfriendly (10+ Hostile Meter points):</span> Once our Kingdom is Unfriendly toward another, a number of additional sorcery and thievery operations become available to our opponent.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Hostile (30+ Hostile Meter points):</span> Once our Kingdom is Hostile toward another, the enemy Kingdom will have the ability to declare War against us (if we are in War Range), and their mana/stealth cost of operations against us is reduced to 2%.</li>
	<li><span class="red">War:</span> See below for more information on how to declare War, and the effects of going to War with another kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hostile Meter has a cap of 90 points. Attacks and operations after this point will no longer add to the Hostile Meter. However, beware - if both kingdoms reach this cap, War will automatically be declared between the kingdoms!</p>

<!--
 However, if only one kingdom repeatedly hits while the other does not, once the difference between the Hostile Meter reaches 100, the gains of the hostile kingdom will decline. If one kingdom is at 150 and the other has 0, then gains are reduced by 50%.
-->

<h2 id="section-8">Going to War</h2>

<p>If one Kingdom becomes Hostile toward another kingdom, the Kingdom that is not Hostile will have the opportunity to declare war on the Hostile Kingdom. This will require them to have relations of Unfriendly toward the Kingdom being declared on, and at least three separate provinces from the declaring Kingdom must have attacked or performed operations (excluding intelligence) against the Kingdom being declared on. If two Kingdoms are mutually Hostile, both Kingdoms will have the opportunity to declare War. War can only be declared if the two Kingdoms are in War range - the smaller Kingdom cannot be less than 85% of their opponent's size. This requirement can be bypassed if both Kingdoms reach the Hostile Meter cap of 90 points.</p>

<p>War can also be declared without prior hostilities with the agreement of both Kingdoms. One Kingdom's Monarch or Steward may send a diplomatic War proposal to another Kingdom, which may be be accepted by the recipient Kingdom within the same Utopian day that it is offered. Once the War proposal is accepted, war will commence immediately. War can only be proposed between Kingdoms that are in War range.</p>

<!--

<p>Going to war requires that at least 1 Kingdom is Hostile while the other be at least Unfriendly towards the other. War can only be declared by the Kingdom that is less hostile than their enemy. Several other factors must also be consider, such as whether the Kingdoms fighting are similar in size and whether or not at least 2 provinces from each Kingdom have attacked each other. If these factors are all met, prepare your troops for battle and be ready to declare war. </p>

<p>This is not the only way to achieve war, however. If some of the restrictions for war are not met, war may still be declared but there must be significant hostilities between the Kingdoms. If Kingdoms grow to loathe each other to such length as to both reach the max of the hostile meter, which is 150 points, then either Kingdom may declare war on the other. It should be noted however, that if all restrictions are not satisfied and war is declared in this way, there will be no rewards to the victor.</p>

-->

<p>Once begun, a War entered while Kingdoms are in War range will last for a minimum of 48 days, after which either side may surrender or negotiate a Mutual Peace agreement with their enemies. A Kingdom may only surrender if there have been no military attacks made for at least 2 Utopian days. Lastly, once War has raged for 5 Utopian months, should one Kingdom become more than double the networth of their opponent, the Utopian Lords will force a surrender.</p>

<p>Now, to go into more detail of the specifics of war. Although dangerous and costly, War can be an exciting time for your people; they will move quicker and fight harder. During war:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attack time is reduced, up to a maximum of 25% reduction after 12 Utopian Days of war</li>
	<li>Massacre will do significantly more damage</li>
	<li>Raze destroys buildings instead of land</li>
	<li>Mana and stealth costs for offensive spells and operations is reduced to 2%</li>
	<li>Exploration is 500% more expensive</li>
	<li>The Paradise spell is unavailable</li>
	<li>The Propaganda operation and Amnesia spell becomes available.</li>
	<li>Gains for attacks and operations between our Kingdom and Kingdoms other than our war opponent are reduced by 80% (for attacks and operations against our Kingdom, this effect fades in over the first Utopian month of war)</li>
</ul>

<p>At the conclusion of war, gifts are bestowed upon both kingdoms. The winning Kingdom receives a boost to land and honor, free specialist and building credits, and bonus science books. The losing Kingdom receives a smaller number of building credits in order to assist in their recovery.</p>

<p>After a war ends, a maximum 72 Utopian day ceasefire will commence. During the ceasefire both Kingdoms remain in war relations, thus retaining the protection benefits while rebuilding. After a minimum of 12 Utopian days, either Kingdom may choose to leave the protection of war and venture back into the world. This decision will not affect the other Kingdom. </p>

<p>Upon entering End of War Ceasefire, for both Kingdoms:
<ul>
	<li>All land currently incoming returns immediately, though the armies themselves must still march home</li>
	<li>Birth rate is significantly increased</li>
	<li>We will see an instant population boost if we are under 50% of our maximum population</li>
	<li>Military drafting costs are reduced by 50%</li>
	<li>Any provinces affected by plague will be instantly cured</li>
	<li>Any provinces affected by any negative spells or operations will be instantly cleared.</li>
</ul>

<p>War is serious business and should be treated as such for the entire duration. Any agreements made between Kingdoms to avoid attacking certain provinces, manipulate the duration of war, or to exchange a war win for other resources such as land, honor or gold are not considered acceptable. Such 'fake war' agreements constitute a violation of the<a href='http://wiki.utopia-game.com/index.php?title=Game_Rules' target=blank> Code of Conduct</a> and are subject to disciplinary actions by the Utopian Lords. You are advised not to tempt their judgment.</p>
