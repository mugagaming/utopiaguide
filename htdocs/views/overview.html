<p><span class="initial">W</span>elcome to Utopia, a world like no other, full of war, intrigue, strategy and diplomacy!</p>

<p>I see you are interested in staking your claim in the world of Utopia with a province of your own, my liege. Wonderful! However, there are a few things you should know as you begin your journey. Our advisors have put together this collection of knowledge to help you on your way to becoming a powerful ruler. We encourage all new leaders to take their time to read this wealth of information to learn the intricacies of managing a province in the world of Utopia.</p>

<p>Our scribes last updated this tome on October 17, 2020 and is current to Age 88: Swift Strife. </p>

<h2 id="section-1">Basic Geography</h2>

<p>Utopia is a world of vast oceans dotted with Islands, and on each of these islands are several Kingdoms. Each Kingdom has up to 25 provinces, one of which will be yours to rule over. Together with the rest of your Kingdom, you will play a vital role in war, growth and diplomacy. Govern your peasantry, army, wizards, and thieves - and aim to conquer the world.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Time</h2>

<p>In the realm of Utopia, time moves much faster than it does on Earth. That which you know as an "hour", is a full Utopian Day, and an Earth day is an entire Utopian Month. And yes, this means there are 24 days in a month. Each Utopian Year contains seven months. Know that your advisors do not know of Earth time and will only speak of Utopian time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every Age everyone starts anew with a fledgling province, giving each ruler and each kingdom the opportunity to take the ranks by storm. Each Age lasts about 12 Utopian Years, the equivalent of 12 weeks in Earth time.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Currency</h2>

<p>The currency of choice in the Utopian World is the Gold Coin, noted by "gc". Unfortunately, the peasants of Utopia have no sense of the Dollar, Pound, Franc, or other Earth currencies that you may be familiar with.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Races</h2>

<p>The population of Utopia is made up of a mix of nine races. I advise you to pick your race carefully. Consider also your Kingdom, as they will be an important part of your experience in Utopia. Many Kingdoms choose to make their race and personality choices as a team, and finding the right mix can be an important part of developing your Kingdom strategy.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Avians</span> are a birdlike race with wings that travel lightning fast. As Avians prefer to attack from the air, their military do not use warhorses. Their forces strike with precision and accuracy from the air and disappear so quickly that it is difficult for opposing armies to ambush them. These provinces are best suited to be guided by rulers who can keep up with their speed!</li>
	<li><span class="red">Dwarves</span> are highly adaptable. Depending on the inclinations of those guiding them, they are capable of attacking, magic and thievery, and under the right rule, they can be great economists. Their sturdy and tough armies can make them a force to be reckoned with. Dwarves are also a very hard-working race, with an above-average level of productivity and a particular talent for construction.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Faeries</span> are a quick, nimble and intelligent race, excelling at defending their lands. They are mischievous creatures, thriving on causing chaos - particularly via the methods of magic and thievery.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Humans</span> are proficient in the scientific arts, always seeking to further their knowledge. This unique strength allows them to develop advanced skills in whichever areas they choose.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Orcs</span> are powerful, bloodthirsty attackers. Their aggressive approach yields them great gains in battle, however, their lack of finesse means the arts of magic and thievery present great challenges for them</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Undead</span> are formidable opponents in battle, however their low intelligence hampers their prowess in scholarly endeavours, and their powerful elite units can only be trained through combat. They are carriers of the Plague, and those who encounter them on the battlefield risk infection with this devastating disease.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Halflings</span> are talented saboteurs. Although their small stature means their troops are not especially powerful, it allows them to house large populations, and their armies are equally comfortable attacking and defending.  These cunning creatures are not to be underestimated!</li>
	<li><span class="red">Gnomes</span> are the most mysterious of the races, the Gnomes are short legged individuals who live in natural areas close to the Earth and care for wildlife. Gnomes are versatile and will be a good pick for players who want to focus on combining Attacking with Thievery or Magic.</li>

	<!--
	<li><span class="red">Bocans</span> can take any form, from a satyr to a cat. The only way to spot a Bocan is their eyes, which will glow red, blue, or green. This characteristic makes them excellent thieves. But be careful, they are fiercely independent creatures and may not follow your orders as effectively as you may wish.</li>
		<li><span class="red">Dark Elves</span> are also known for their magical abilities and are evil individuals that like suffering and pain. The Dark Elven mages are the most efficient at performing magic and have developed a unique skill that allows them to generate mystical energies without using runes. Their hostile underground environment has allowed the Dark Elves to develop special offensive manoeuvres, their offensive troops are more efficient than average, as well as a unique spell that makes enemy troops completely harmless! Unfortunately, these rude living conditions also severely hinder their exploring abilities. Overall, Dark Elves are naturally oriented towards Magic and are very efficient at casting the hardest, and most powerful, spells, but they can also handle the Attacker and the Thieves roles very well.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Elves</span> are magical beings naturally inclined to spellcasting, regenerating their energies much more quickly than other races. Alongside their taste for the mystical arts, they can also be formidable attackers.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Dryads</span> are shrouded in mystery. Not many live to tell of their interactions with this race. Sheltering deep in the forests and luring the unsuspecting with their beauty and charm to fight with extraordinary strength. These masterfully elusive creatures wield unmatched power through a combination of cunning and finesse which, to their detriment, deals less overall damage to their enemies and requires an excess of planning to bring their armies back home.</li>

<h2 id="section-5">Personalities</h2>

<p>As well as a race, you will also choose a personality. Utopian rulers have nine different personalities to choose from. Although there is no ‘best’ combination, new rulers who are just starting out are advised to pick a race and personality that share similar core strengths to build upon - for example, if you have chosen an attacking-oriented race, such as Orc, you might consider pairing it with a similarly oriented personality, such as Warrior.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">The Rogue </span> is a master thief, well trained in the arts of stealing and sabotage. Operating in the darkest of shadows, the Rogue is able to perform dastardly acts others can scarcely imagine.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Mystic</span> is a powerful mage, with the ability to visit devastating destruction upon their enemies through spellcasting.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Cleric</span> is a noble and resilient fighter. The Cleric is especially gifted at supporting others, with the ability to cast unique spells on their allies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Warrior</span> wields a great strength on the battlefield, preferring an aggressive approach to overpowering their enemies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Tactician</span> is a strategic mastermind, targeting their enemies’ weaknesses with deadly cunning and precision. The Tactician is renowned for their speed on the battlefield.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Heretic</span> adheres to an unorthodox combination of thievery and magic, combining both fields into unique talents of damage and destruction. Although they can sometimes find their more specialised counterparts to present a challenge, adept Heretic rulers can still find greatness.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The War Hero</span> is known for their great deeds on the battlefield, and for their firm belief that with risks come great rewards. They fight valiantly and reap rewards such as honor and promotions to elite ranks.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Artisan</span> is a swift and resourceful builder, as well as a careful manager of economy.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Raider</span> combines thievery and ruthlessness to convert captured enemies into their own ranks.</li>


	<!--
	<li><span class="red">The Paladin</span> has a gift unlike any other, with the ability to cast spells on their Kingdom mates comes great responsibility! Paladins have developed their magic skills far beyond that of a regular spellcaster, with unique spells capable of providing bonuses unattainable through normal means. Capable of destruction, Paladins forge their path through the endowment of their allies, the noblest of causes.</li>
		<li><span class="red">The Sages</span> are gifted scholars, renowned for their swift scientific progress and advanced knowledge. However, they are by nature cautious, and take great care to safeguard their learning.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Undead</span> will make any race unnatural beings with amazingly unique abilities. They are generally rotting to pieces and carry the plague (a highly contagious disease that will kill the living but seems to provide the Undead the strength they need to survive) with them wherever they walk. This strength allows them to continue fighting through even the most grievous of wounds, effectively lowering their casualties in battle.</li>
