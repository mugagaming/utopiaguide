<h2 id="section-1">Using your Thieves</h2>

<img src="images/bocan.png" alt="Bocan">

<p>Moving through the shadows, our thieves are an essential part of our kingdom operations. We can send our thieves to conduct espionage against our enemies, or to perform acts of sabotage to disrupt their operations. The success rate of our operations depends on our thievery effectiveness relative to that of our enemy. Thievery effectiveness is primarily determined by the number of thieves we have in relation to the size of our lands. Factors that contribute to our overall thievery effectiveness may include racial and personality bonuses, our honour level, our investment in Crime science, and any Thieves’ Dens we have built. However – no matter how effective our thieves, they can also be thwarted by our enemies’ Watch Towers, or the Clear Sight spell.  Our thieves rely on stealth to perform their dastardly deeds; each operation you send your thieves on will consume a small amount of stealth, which then recharges slowly over time. Your thieves do have a sense of self-preservation, and will refuse to perform operations if their stealth drops below 5%.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Thief Operations</h2>

<p>Gathering intelligence on your enemies is a crucial part of warfare and our thieves have a variety of different operations to obtain this information. To ensure accurate results, you must send 10% of your thieves on each infiltration.</p>
