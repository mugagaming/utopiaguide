<h2 id="section-1">Lobby</h2>

<p>My liege, allow me to take a little time to note some things that you may have missed thus far in your Utopian travels, as I am sure you were most eager to begin adventuring! Upon entering the world of Utopia you will land in the Lobby. From here you can choose the server you wish to enter, and view details about the current age.</p>

<p>Once you have selected a server you will see a link to your province, and to any provinces that you are currently sitting or mentoring. It displays your Province name and location as well as our Kingdom name. Take comfort in reading that your province is alive as this may not always be the case! Utopia is a vast and dangerous land in which casualties are a common occurrence.</p>

<p>If you haven't found your home yet, this is where you can look for one. In recruitment you can see how many kingdoms are using the in game recruitment and how many of those may consider inviting you. Clicking on "x want players like you" will take you to a list of kingdoms you can apply to.
When a kingdom decides you are just the person they need to make their kingdom complete they will send you an invitation and said invitation will be displayed next to "invitations".</p>

<p>Underneath your province link you will find a quick link to this age's race and personality changes in case you need a reference as well as a link to the game rules.</p>

<p>Clicking on your province name, or that of a province you are sitting, will take you to the Throne page, my Liege. Enter if you dare!</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Game Account</h2>

<p>The time has come, my Liege, to spend a little time on the less exciting but yet important things. While bureaucracy is kept to a minimum it still exists. May I direct your attention to the upper right corner of the screen, please?! You will see your account name with a drop down menu. It is here that you can do such things as removing advertising and changing your account information or password. If you so choose you can add a custom theme or one of the integrated ones. You may also choose to set up a public profile.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Bug Reporting</h2>

<p>Last but not least you will find the place to report bugs here. If you encounter a bug, do not hesitate to let the Utopian Lords know. Once you click on "report bug" you will be given a personal ID number. Use this ID while making a report so the Utopian Lords can properly investigate and fix the issue without further ado.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Abuse Reporting</h2>

<p>Occasionally you may encounter other players who are violating the Game Rules. The Utopian Lords appreciate your assistance in helping to keep the world of Utopia free of harassment and cheating by reporting such behavior.</p>

<p>Mail sent in game has a direct report option, which can be found by mousing over the top right corner. The same is true for all kingdom and war forum posts as well as posts in the official game forum.</p>

<p>All other issues such as suspected cheating and offensive kingdom or province names can be reported by sending an email to support at: <a href="mailto:UtopiaSupport@Utopia-Game.com">UtopiaSupport@Utopia-Game.com</a></p>

<p>The support team can also help you with other issues such as difficulties logging in.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Province Settings</h2>

<p>At the bottom of your left sidebar you will find a preferences link, my Liege.</p>

<p>The first option you will find here is the opportunity to change details about your province. After the age begins, this is a premium feature and requires purchasing a Shop item to complete. If you only wish to change your province and/or ruler name, you can do this without affecting your province's resources. If you also wish to change your race and personality selection after the age has begun, this requires a full reset of your province and you will start from scratch at 400 acres. Note that you can only change your province details after a full 24 hours of taking no aggressive actions. Aggressive actions in the eyes of the Lords of Utopia include attacks and operations (including intelligence) against any other province, as well as sending aid within your own kingdom.</p>

<p>Your kingdom and province need your attention daily. Should you be unable to tend to your loyal subjects for an extended period of time you have two options to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can enter vacation mode, which will temporarily pause your province. While your province is in vacation mode, it will generate no resources, and actions cannot be performed by or against you. Vacation mode will take effect 24 hours after you activate it, and will be cancelled if you perform any aggressive action during this time - so plan ahead!</li>
	<li>You can have a trusted kingdom member sit your province. This means they will be able to access and control your province while you are away, and your province will continue to generate resources. The minimum time before sitting can be cancelled is 1 hour and the maximum time a province can be sat per age is 30 days.  It should be noted that a minimum of 12 hours will be removed from the 30 day limit each time a sitter is designated, regardless of the time sat. This means sitting can be set a maximum of 60 times age. In order to set a sitter you will need to purchase credits from the Utopian Lords in the shop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should you simply require occasional assistance with maintaining your province, you can also select a Mentor for your province. This is highly recommended for new players. Your Mentor must be a player within your kingdom who has purchased Gold status in the Shop (you do not neeed to have purchased Gold status), and they can only serve as a Mentor for one province at a time. Once you have assigned a player as your Mentor, they will be able to assume control of your province for up to 4 hours, a maximum of once per 24 hours. Be aware that similarly to province sitting, once your Mentor takes control of your province, you yourself will be unable to access it for a minimum of 1 hour.</p>

<p>If you wish to leave your kingdom, you can uproot your province and move to a new kingdom using a Random Move. But be warned, my liege, in the upheaval you will lose a signicant portion of your province resources - and there are no guarantees as to where you'll end up!</p>

<p> Finally, if you wish, you may abandon your lands and people. You can do this in two ways. You can simply abandon your province, leaving it intact, which will allow your Kingdom's Monarch to invite a new ruler to assume control. Or, if you wish vengeance, you can instead choose to destroy your lands entirely. Please take great care in performing these actions, my liege, as they cannot be undone!</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Premium Features</h2>

<p>As always, Utopia remains a free-to-play, no download required, browser-based web game. However, if you would like to show your support and contribute to the continued development and evolution of the game that sparked an industry standard in massive online multiplayer gaming, there are a number of premium items that can be purchased within the Shop. While these items do not offer gameplay advantage, they are designed to enhance your game play experience and provide added convenience. Items you can purchase include ad removal, province sitting, personal and kingdom Hostile Meters, Taunts, and Kingdom invitations.</p>


<p>You can also purchase Gold status, which offers a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Personal hostile meter</li>
	<li>Special Discord role</li>
	<li>3 free sitting credits per month</li>
	<li>Ability to Mentor another province within your kingdom</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to fully activate your Gold status, once you purchse and use the item in the shop, you must log out of your account and then log back in. Once you do so, you can contact a Game Support member in Discord, and they can assign you the role of "Gold Status".</p>

<p>Your display of support by purchasing Gold status is greatly appreciated by the Lords of Utopia. As well as the benefits rewarded for this purchase, please accept their thanks for your contribution to the continued development and support of the world of Utopia.</p>
