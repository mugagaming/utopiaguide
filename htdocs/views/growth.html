<h2 id="section-1">Your People</h2>

<p>As our esteemed leader, it is up to you to find the right balance between our economy and military. Too little army, and we may find ourselves much too exposed to outside threats from our enemies. Too large an army, and our peasants will struggle to generate the income needed to pay them.</p>

<p>As we grow in size, our maximum population increases, allowing us to build and strengthen. However, our peasants and military will quickly become dissatisfied should we no longer have sufficient living space, and our peoples will begin to abandon our lands. If we become significantly overpopulated, we will find that our military and thieves refuse to work, and our peasants will riot in the streets. Should we lose all our peasants, our lands will crumble and be destroyed. Carefully managing our population is an important part of ruling a province in Utopia.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Employment</h2>

<p>To maintain a healthy economy, our peasants need employment to generate income. Once our lands are built, our peasants will be able to find employment. All buildings other than Homes (which employ no one) provide 25 jobs, and each peasant is capable of working 1.5 jobs. The Building Advisor shows us the number of jobs available, the number of workers available, and the number of workers needed to maximise our Building Efficiency. </p>

<h2 id="section-3">Income</h2>

<p>Our primary source of income is the taxes we collect from our peasants. Employed peasants generate a base rate of 2.75 GC per Utopian day, while unemployed peasants generate a third of this rate. Our income can increase with honour, alchemy science, or racial and personality bonuses. We can also increase our income by building Banks, which will generate a flat amount of gold per day, as well as providing a boost to the amount we collect from peasants. Lastly, if our Kingdom casts an Affluent ritual, we will see a significant increase to our daily income.</p>

<p>A number of factors can also decrease the income we receive; for example, if we are suffering from Riots or the Plague, or if our Kingdom is being ravaged by a Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">The State Advisor</h2>

<p>Our Affairs of the State Advisor provides details on our current population, economy, current highlights, as well as the recent trends for incoming and outgoing resources.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our Population - Provides details of our current and maximum population that our lands can support, and information about how our population is distributed.</li>
	<li>Our Economy - Report on our expected income and wages for the upcoming tick as well as shows the employment level of our peasants</li>
	<li>Current Highlights - Shows our current networth, land size, and honor, as well as our current standing compared with all other provinces in Utopia.</li>
	<li>Recent Trends - Displays trends in our production and consumption of resources - gold, food, and runes - and in our growth or loss of peasants for the previous tick, the current month and the previous month.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-5">Building Efficiency</h2>

<p>With the exception of capacity buildings, such as homes, stables, and dungeons, our Building Efficiency (BE) will increase or decrease the benefits received from our buildings. We can improve our BE by increasing the percentage of available jobs that are filled, and by investing in the study of Tools science.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Exploration</h2>

<p>One option available to us to increase our land size is to explore by equipping an expedition with soldiers and gold. The land from this trip will become available over 24 ticks. In order to explore, we must have at least half our current existing acres built or undergoing construction and our explore pool must have enough land in it. Each Province has a set exploration pool that can be used up by casting paradise or exploring and it will increase slightly with each day.</p>

<p>The cost of exploration will increase depending on our size, and it will increase 500% during war and only slightly increased during End of War Cease-Fire. It is recommended to explore during normal to avoid these extra costs, or during End of War Cease-Fire while you're protected, just be sure not to over-extend yourself so that you have enough military to protect your lands.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">Construction</h2>

<p>When we have unbuilt acres, it is strongly recommended to build them as soon as possible. The construction cost and time can be impacted by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Casting Builder's Boon - Increase speed 25%</li>
	<li>Use Accelerated Construction - Twice the cost for double the speed</li>
	<li>The Expedient Ritual - -20% cost and -25% speed</li>
	<li>Being a Dwarf - -50% construction costs </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-8">Buildings and Construction</h2>

<p>Built acres can provide a huge advantage to our province. Buildings take 16 Utopian days to complete, however we can reduce this by casting the Builder's Boon spell, by using Accelerated Construction to build more quickly at a higher price, or by investing in Artisan science. Our construction time and cost will also decrease if our Kingdom casts an Expedient ritual. Dwarves and Artisans also benefit from reduced construction time. Now, a quick overview of the benefits provided by each building type:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b class="red">Homes</b> - While all land houses people, dedicating land to housing provides additional population capacity as well as increasing birth rate.  Homes do not employ anyone. </li>
	<li><b class="red">Mills</b> - Reduce the resources needed for exploring, and construction costs.
	<li><b class="red">Training Grounds</b> - Designating a portion of your land for your troops to train will increase our Offensive Military Efficiency.
	<li><b class="red">Barracks</b> - By providing our troops with Barracks, we are able to reduce our attack times.
	<li><b class="red">Guard Stations</b> - Decrease in land loss, gold, food, and runes when attacked.
	<li><b class="red">Guilds</b> - Our wizards need a place to live and study.  Our Guilds will take a small number of peasants each day and train them into wizards. Guilds are also required for us to cast self spells and the amount of Guilds will impact their duration.
	<li><b class="red">Thieves' Dens</b> - Increase our thievery effectiveness as well as reducing the losses of thieves during operations.
	<li><b class="red">Stables</b> - Breed, train and house War Horses which can be used by our military to strengthen our offense.
	<li><b class="red">Farms</b> - Generate bushels of food to feed our people, and ensure our peasants and military don't starve to death!
	<li><b class="red">Banks</b> - Produce a flat amount of gold per tick, as well as provide a percentage boost to our current income.
	<li><b class="red">Armouries</b> - Better prepare our army and decrease draft costs, training costs and wages.
	<li><b class="red">Forts</b> - Increase our Defensive Military Efficiency.
	<li><b class="red">Hospitals</b> - Decrease our military losses during all attacks, and has a bonus chance of curing the plague each tick.
	<li><b class="red">Towers</b> - Produce new runes each day, allowing our wizards to cast spells.
	<li><b class="red">Watchtowers</b> - Guard our lands against enemy thieves by increasing our chance to catch them and lower our losses incurred by any successful operations against us.
	<li><b class="red">Universities</b> - Protects books against Learn attacks and increases the speed at which new scientists are generated and increases book production.
	<li><b class="red">Libraries</b> - Libraries increase science efficiency.
	<li><b class="red">Dungeons</b> - We need a place to hold prisoners gained from making attacks. Prisoners will generate a small amount of revenue from the work they perform while incarcerated, and can be sent in limited numbers alongside our armies to attack. Deserting troops will become prisoners who can generate gc for your province and assist in attacking.
</ul>

<h2 id="section-9">The Building Advisor</h2>

<p>The Building Advisor reports our:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Current Building Efficiency</li>
	<li>Available Jobs</li>
	<li>Available Workers (aka current peasants)</li>
	<li>Building Quantities and Percentage of Total lands</li>
	<li>Current effects from built lands</li>
	<li>Schedule for incoming explorated lands and buildings in progress</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-10">Honor and Ranks</h2>

<p>As our province performs noble deeds, such as conducting attacks or performing thievery or magic operations, our honor increases. As we gain honor, we progress through nobility ranks. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Peasant (0-750)</li>
	<li>Knight or Lady (751-1500)</li>
	<li>Lord or Noble Lady (1501-2250)</li>
	<li>Baron or Baroness (2251-3000)</li>
	<li>Viscount or Viscountess (3001-3750)</li>
	<li>Count or Countess (3751-4500)</li>
	<li>Marquis or Marchioness (4501-5250)</li>
	<li>Duke or Duchess (5251-6000)</li>
	<li>Prince or Princess (6001+)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can learn more about Honor and their effects <a href="http://wiki.utopia-game.com/index.php?title=Honor#Honor_Effects" target=blank> HERE!</a></p>

<p>With each increase in rank, we receive bonuses to our population, offensive military efficiency, income, and thievery and magic effectiveness. Some ranks are also associated with an increased number of votes for our Kingdom's Monarchy.

<p>Upon the founding of our province, we begin with no honor. However, over the first seven and a half real-life days our honor will steadily increase on its own. After that, it will be up to us to gain honour through our achievements. As with land and other resources, our honour gains will be best when we attack enemies of a similar size. Honor gains are drastically reduced when taking advantage of smaller enemies, or when being a pest towards substantially larger opponents. We will not gain honor from non-land attacks (such as Learn or Plunder), nor from any attack where we use Anonymity.</p>

<p>Honor can be lost as well as gained - when we suffer attacks, magic or thievery operations, these defeats will often cost us honor.</p>
