<h2 id="section-1">Dragon Types</h2>

<p>Be careful, my liege, these dangerous and powerful beasts can wreak havoc on any kingdom they are ravaging. Our Monarch or Steward can begin a dragon project against our enemies, which will need to be funded with gold before it will set flight to attack our enemy. Dragons that are upon our lands can be slain by attacking them with our troops - however, all troops that are sent to fight a dragon will perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>There are five varieties of dragon, each with different costs and health levels. All dragons cause a 10% decrease in income, 10% decrease in food production, the loss of 20% of drafted soldiers and will also destroy 3% of your buildings every 6 ticks! Each type of dragon also has an additional special effect, these are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Sapphire</span> - Reduces magic and thievery effectiveness by 25%.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Topaz</span> - Reduces building efficiency by 25%.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Amethyst</span> - Reduces science effectiveness by 25%</li>
	<li><span class="red">Ruby</span> - Reduces military efficiency by 10%.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Emerald</span> - Increases military casualties in combat by 20% and reduces attack gains by 15%.</li>
	
</ul>

<h2 id="section-2">Sending a Dragon</h2>

<p>Once our kingdom has begun a dragon project, we will need to fund it with gold from our coffers. The cost of a dragon is determined at the beginning of the project, and is based on both our own and our enemy's kingdom net worth, as well as the type of dragon chosen. From least to most expensive, the dragon types are Sapphire, Gold, Ruby and Emerald.</p>

<p>Dragon health is determined when the dragon is sent, and is based on the networth of the target kingdom as well as our relations with them. A dragon will have maximum health if the project is completed while we are at war with the target, reduced if our relations are Hostile and further reduced if we are Unfriendly. Beware that sending a dragon will significantly impact on our relations with the target kingdom, adding 30 points to the <a href="https://utopia-game.com/guide/politics/?section=7" style="color: blue;">Hostile Meter</a></p>

<p>Some final notes of caution, my liege. Although only our Monarch or Steward can begin a dragon project, any member of our kingdom (except for provinces under Game Protection) can make the final payment required to set the dragon in flight. As the funding of a dragon is a very costly undertaking for our kingdom, we should take care to choose the right time to complete our project! Know also that dragons are greedy creatures - if we choose to cancel our dragon project before it is funded, none of the gold invested will be returned to us. Finally, I must warn you that entering into a Ceasefire with a kingdom - including an End of War Ceasefire -  will result in the cancellation of any unfinished dragon project targeted at that kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Slaying a Dragon</h2>

<p>Once a dragon has begun ravaging our lands, we can slay it by sending troops to fight it. Soldiers, specialists and elites sent into battle against a dragon will reduce its health by the amount of their highest stat (for example, a 3/8 elite fights at 8 points). Investment in Valor science provides our troops with training in dragon combat and will increase the damage they do when sent to slay dragons. But my liege, be warned - all troops sent to fight a dragon will perish in the attempt. </p>

<p>A dragon that is not slain will fly away on its own after 120 Utopian days. Provinces that are under Game Protection cannot send troops to fight a dragon.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Ritual Types</h2>

<p>As with dragons, kingdom ritual projects can only be started by a Monarch or Steward. Once the project has begun, provinces within our kingdom (except those under Game Protection) can contribute by casting ritual spells. These are difficult and costly spells, so it is wise to plan carefully. A minimum of 40 casts are required for a successful ritual and these must be cast within 48 Utopian days, or the ritual project will fail. The base effects for each ritual (listed below) require 80 casts to achieve - we can also perform additional casts for increased effect. Rituals will automatically be activated after 48 Utopian days, as long as the minimum number of casts has been performed. The kingdom's Monarch or Steward can also choose to activate the ritual prior to this time.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Affluent</span> - Income +20%, Draft Speed +25%</li>
	<li><span class="red">Barrier</span> - -20% Spell/Thief Defensive damage, +20% Defensive TPA/WPA</li>
	<li><span class="red">Benediction</span> - +10% Building Efficiency, -20% Military Wages, +40% Birth Date</li>
	<li><span class="red">Expedient</span> - -20% Military Train time, -25% Training Costs (including Thieves), -20% Construction Time, -25% Construction Costs</li>
	<li><span class="red">Godspeed</span> - -10% attack speed, 15% Less Military Casualties on Offense</li>
	<li><span class="red">Havoc</span> - +30% offensive Thieves per acre (TPA) and Wizards per acre (WPA) by 30%, +20% spell and thievery damage</li>
	<li><span class="red">Onslaught</span> - +10% Offensive Military Efficiency (OME), +20% enemy casualties suffered from our attacks</li>
	<li><span class="red">Expropriation</span> - +10% combat gains, +20% honor gains on attacks, +20% credits gained in combat</li>
	<li><span class="red">Stalwart</span> - +10% Defensive Military Efficiecy, -10% Enemy Combat Gains</li>
</ul>

<p>Kingdom Rituals provide significant benefits. Their bonuses affect all Kingdom members immediately upon completion and will normally last 120 Utopian days, unless abolished by an enemy. We will also observe some natural decay in the strength of our ritual as time passes. A kingdom can only have one ritual active at a time.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Abolishing a Ritual</h2>

<p>It is possible to destroy an enemy kingdom's ritual. This can be done by casting the offensive Abolish Ritual spell against provinces in the enemy kingdom, and requires a minimum of Unfriendly relations. 50 successful casts are required to abolish a ritual, and we can only cast a maximum of 10 abolish spells on any single province - therefore, we must cast on at least 5 different provinces in an enemy kingdom in order to destroy their ritual. Although we can begin the task of abolishing an enemy ritual at any time, the ritual will not be destroyed until a minimum of 48 Utopian days have passed since its activation.</p>
