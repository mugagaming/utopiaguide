<h2 id="section-1">Drafting Soldiers</h2>

<img src="images/orc2.png" alt="Orc">

<p>It is imperative that we maintain an army for the survival of our province. To begin building our army, we must navigate to our Military tab using our left sidebar. From this page we can select our draft rate and target, as well as adjust our wage levels and train our soldiers into advanced troops.</p>

<p>The first step to developing our military is to recruit from the ranks of our peasants. Our recruiters can draft basic soldiers at varying speeds; however, the faster we recruit the more it will cost us per soldier. Our wizards can also help increase the efficiency of our drafting by casting Patriotism over our lands. We should also ensure we set our draft target; once this is reached, we will not draft additional soldiers. Consider carefully how you wish to balance your military and your peasantry - maintaining a large army can be expensive!</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Training your Military</h2>

<p>Once we have drafted some soldiers, we can further train them as offense specialists, defense specialists, elites, or thieves. These units will be called by different names depending on the race we have chosen, and their strength and training cost can also vary by race. We can see the strength and price of each unit on our Military page. Strength is expressed as Off/Def - for example, a 6/0 Ranger fights with 6 offensive points but will not assist in defending our lands at all. Consider carefully our desired balance between defending our own lands and conquering our enemies!</p>

	<!--
<p>However, each province and kingdom can have their own opinions on how to assign their armies. Some of these opinions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100% elites - The strengths of this strategy depends on your race but running this strategy as an attacker, such as a dryad or an orc, would be suicidal and would be a detriment to your kingdom. Elites are also very costly so it can take a long time to train an army full of them.</li>
	<li>High Defense, No Offense - With such high offense with attackers, becoming unbreakable is very difficult to achieve but can be a great benefit to our kingdom if we are able to get there; however, as the saying goes "There is always a bigger fish" and running this strategy can be very risky.</li>
	<li>High Defense, Low Offense - Typically used by thief- and mage-style provinces, it provides strong defensive capabilities while still providing us with some recourse to either ambush a hit against us or helping to keep a chained target down while in war. This is a very common strategy and easy to maintain.</li>
	<li>Middle Defense and Offense - Utilized by hybrids that wish to be a little harder to break than an attacker would be, but still having enough offense to make a larger hit or several smaller hits against our enemies. While this is a solid strategy for some provinces in a kingdom, if too many operate like this then the kingdom can suffer as the enemy could more easily achieve unbreakables and we may not be able to do multiple Traditional Marches per wave due to lower offense.</li>
	<li>High Offense, Low Defense - "The best defense is a good offense" is a long-time battle strategy. While this can be a good strategy to help stop the enemy gaining any unbreakables, we may be attacked multiples times due to the low defense so it relies on us making multiple hits and having a steady stream of incoming land to offset that damage too. This is a good strategy for people that can regularly keep their army out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-3">Paying your Army</h2>

<p>I caution you though, my liege, should we recruit too large an army, we may find that the income received from our remaining peasants will not be enough to support their wages. Should we fail to pay our army, we will find them unwilling to attack at all! Our army will only go into battle if they were paid their wages for the previous Utopian day.</p>

<p>We can select a wage rate of anywhere from 10% to 200% of normal wages to pay our army. By paying a higher wage, we can increase the efficiency of our military, while paying a lower wage will result in decreased military efficiency. We can adjust our wage rate at any time, allowing us to adapt to our situation.</p>

<p>Wages are not required for regular soldiers, thieves or troops that are currently in training.</p>

	<!--
<ul>
	<li>50% - Training Pump - While this will slowly reduce their military efficiency, it will allow us to train more troops. It is best used only during fortified stance or in the end-of-war ceasefire.</li>
	<li>50% - Chained Survival - When in war, if we are chained heavily we will likely not have the income to sustain much of an army so we should lower our wages to 50% and ask for aid from our kingdom mates if we are losing gold per day. When heavily chained, we receive a military efficiency bonus from the gang-bang protection so the slow lowering of the efficiency due to wages is pretty negligible.</li>
	<li>100 to 150% - Maintaining - Used to maintain a steady military efficiency and wages balance. Best used during normal or aggressive when looking around for a war.</li>
	<li>200% - Pumped for War - In times of hostilities and war, paying our troops 200% wages will increase their efficiency which can mean the difference between being unbreakable or not for thieves or mystics; or for attackers, being able to make a Traditional March per general or having to conquest for reduced land gains with one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-4">The Military Advisor</h2>

<p>Our Military Advisor details information about our armies that are at home as well as those that are out on missions, and those in training. The Military Advisor provides us with four reports:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wage Rate - Shows the wage rate of our armies, as well as the base military efficiency resulting from our wage rate.</li>
	<li>Military Strength - Displays our offensive and defensive military efficiency, including bonuses from science, honour, buildings, spells, Multi-Attack Protection, and any applicable racial or personality bonuses. This report also notes our total offense and defense points currently at home.</li>
	<li>Army Availability - Shows us the number of troops at home (this is our Standing Army), as well as providing us with information about the number of our generals and troops that are currently away conducting attacks. For armies out on attacks, we will also see the amounts of any land they have captured, as well as their expected time of return, allowing us to plan ahead.</li>
	<li>Military Training Estimates - Details the number of each type of troop that is in training, as well as the number of Utopian days remaining until each troop is trained.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-5">Attack types</h2>
<p>Now that we have built up our military, our military commanders await your orders on how to deploy our troops. We have a number of generals available to lead our armies. While one general must always remain at home to command our defenses, the others can be sent to lead our attacks. We can send each general to lead an army each, or send more than one general with our attacks to boost our army’s offensive abilities.</p>
<p>There are a number of different types of attacks we can conduct. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Traditional March - Capture a portion of our enemy's land and awards it to us when our army returns.</li>
	<li>Raze - Outside of war, Raze will simply destroy a portion of our enemy's land. During war, it will burn a portion of the enemy's buildings, reverting them to unbuilt acres.</li>
	<li>Plunder - Capture a portion of the enemy’s gold, food and runes and immediately returns it to us.</li>
	<!--
	<li>Abduct - Kidnaps a portion of the enemy's scientists and immediately returns them to us with their current knowledge intact.</li>
	-->
	<li>Learn - Outside of war, Learn attacks steal a portion of our enemy's science books and immediately awarding them to us. A significantly higher portion of unallocated books will be stolen than of allocated books. During war, Learn attacks reduce our enemy's science effectiveness for the remainder of the duration of war.</li>
	<li>Massacre - Kills a portion of the enemy's peasants, thieves and wizards.</li>
	<li>Conquest - Similar to a traditional march, Conquests capture enemy land. However, we do not need to completely break our enemy’s defenses to conduct a Conquest attack. Because we will eventually be turned back, we will capture a smaller portion of land than if we overpowered our enemy with a Traditional March. We will also suffer significantly higher losses of our own men.</li>
	<li>Ambush - Quickly chase after the army that attacked us to recapture half of the land they stole from us. Anonymous attacks and those conducted using the War Spoils spell may not be ambushed, nor can we ambush non-land attacks such as Learn or Plunder. We have only until our enemies’ armies return to their own lands with their spoils to ambush their attacks, or the opportunity is lost to us forever. Further, we can only attempt to ambush each successful land attack against us once – if we fail, we are unable to ambush that attack.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-6">Target finding</h2>

<p>With risk comes reward. There will be plenty of opportunities to attack the smaller, weaker lands around the world, plenty of bullies looking to attack you, and plenty of chances to feed on the remains of provinces already ravished by others. The Lords understand this is not noble, and they will see to it that this behavior is not rewarded. The best gains are acquired by striking provinces around the same land and networth size as our own Province, and that belong to a kingdom of relative strength. The Target Finder is a useful resource for finding provinces within our range, and can be sorted by race or to exclude provinces who are in war.</p>

<p>Our gains are also affected by a number of other factors. If our enemy has Guard Stations, this will reduce our gains from attacks on them. Our gains on provinces whose kingdoms are at war will be very low (and we may find that the act of attacking such a province will be viewed poorly by our comrades). Finally, provinces that have been attacked recently are offered some temporary protection by the Utopian Lords – attacking these provinces will also yield lower gains. We can also increase our gains by investing in Siege science.</p>

<!--

<p> A few strategies to consider when selecting a target are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attacking a thief/mage - They will typically have higher defenses and lower offense so they can't retaliate your hits; however, they may have kingdom mates that will be happy to avenge a hit against their friend. For war heroes, attacking a province with higher defense will result in more conversion of specialists into elites as well.</li>
	<li>Hitting an attacker with army at home - There is nothing more devastating to an attacker than being hit with full army at home. It cripples their defense and offense plus will cause overpopulation meaning they can't send out their army until after they release some of it.</li>
	<li>Hitting an attacker with army out - Snatching the news of a kingdom will typically allow you to see who might have their armies out, which means they'll have lower defense at home. If we are fast enough, we could hit and be home before their army even returns which will prevent them from ambushing our hits. Since they will have lower defense, it's likely that we could hit multiple times. I caution you though, each subsequent hit will lower the gains we receive and if our kingdom has hit into theirs 3 times, it'll make us unfriendly to them and open up the option for their thieves and mages to make deadly operations and spells against us.</li>
	<li>Spreading hits out to different kingdoms - This takes longer to set-up as we need to find multiple targets, it will allow for higher gains than multiple hits on a single target, and help avoid giving away unfriendly relations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-7">Attacking your enemy</h2>

<p>Once we have a target in sight, we will need to obtain intelligence to allow us to conduct a successful attack against them. By spying on their military, we can see how much defense is currently protecting their lands. There is a small random factor applied to all attacks, which means that we need to send slightly more offense than the target’s defense in order to ensure that our attack does not fail. It is recommended that we send around 104% of our target's defense. But beware – if the target sees our thieves prowling about their lands, they may take their own measures to avoid our invasion!

<p>Once we know how much defense our target has, we are ready to make our attack. In the War Room, we must select our target, the type of attack we wish to make, the number of generals we wish to send on the attack and any adjustments we wish to make to our attack speed. After entering our target’s defense, we then select the number and type of troops we wish to send on the attack. In addition to the offensive units we can draft and train as part of our military (soldiers, offensive specialists and elites), we can choose to include other units as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>War Horses – These are produced by Stables, or can be stolen from our enemies. Any War Horses that are not out on attack and that cannot be housed by our Stables will flee our lands over time. War Horses add strength to our offensive troops, and we cannot send a War Horse to battle without a rider! Avian armies, being inclined to flight, do not make use of War Horses.</li>
	<li>Prisoners – When we make attacks, we have the ability to capture a portion of our enemy’s troops and bring them back to our lands as Prisoners. Prisoners are kept in Dungeons – if we do not have any Dungeons, we will not capture Prisoners on attacks. A limited number of prisoners can be sent on attacks to fight alongside our armies.</li>
	<li>Mercenaries – At times, we may find ourselves in need of a small boost to our army. This can be achieved by hiring Mercenaries, who will fight for us in a single battle – at a cost. We are limited in the number of Mercenaries we can send, as they require considerable supervision from our trained military!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-8">Attacking your allies</h2>

<p>Provinces within our kingdom are our allies. While conflict is inevitable, the Utopian Lords frown upon war amongst comrades. However, at times it may be desired to attack within our own Kingdom. Be first warned that attacking a province within our own Kingdom will cause enormous damage, yet will result in very little reward for us.</p>
